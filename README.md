## About this modification

This fork is integrated with [VLC](https://github.com/videolan/vlc) Video player for ~~slacking off immersively~~ when coding.üòù

![feature](feature.png)

This project is based on the VLC of a preview release 4.0+.

It needs an exporting library (.lib) for linking to VLC runtime if it will be compiled successfully on Windows. But I have not yet provided this .lib file. You could generate it according to this [tutorial](https://wiki.videolan.org/GenerateLibFromDll/). It lacks of a GUI based control panel for video playing and will be added later.
